# 5.1 — Eye and Respiratory Safety

Cyberdecks are built with solder, plastics, adhesives, cutters, grinders, and mystery dust.

Most build injuries are boring:

- a hot fleck of solder in the eye
- flux fumes in a closed room
- sanding dust in lungs
- a Dremel disc that explodes

This chapter is about preventing the boring injuries.

It is not medical advice.

If you have specific health concerns, use manufacturer safety data sheets (SDS) and consult a qualified professional.

## 1. The principle: engineering controls first, PPE second

**Definition:**

- **Personal protective equipment (PPE)** is equipment (goggles, masks/respirators, etc.) designed to protect the wearer from hazards; it reduces exposure when other controls are not feasible or effective.

The correct order of operations:

1. eliminate/substitute the hazard (use less nasty materials)
2. engineering controls (ventilation, fume extraction, guards)
3. administrative controls (work practices, cleanup)
4. PPE

You can’t “mask your way out” of a smoke-filled room.

## 2. Eye safety (because eyes don’t get do-overs)

### 2.1 What hits your eyes in deck building

- clipped wire leads
- solder splatter
- flux spatter
- plastic shards from drilling/cutting
- abrasive dust

**Definition:**

- **Safety glasses** are eye protection (PPE) worn to shield eyes from debris and injury.

Practical rules:

- wear eye protection any time something can fly
- if you’re cutting/grinding, prefer full-seal goggles or a face shield in addition to glasses
- keep eye protection *at the workstation* so it’s frictionless

## 3. Respiratory safety (fumes and particles)

### 3.1 Soldering and flux

**Definition:**

- **Soldering** joins metal surfaces using a filler metal (solder), commonly used in electronics.

Flux is often involved.

**Definition:**

- In metallurgy, a **flux** is a chemical agent used in metal joining to remove oxidation and facilitate soldering.

The practical hazard is not usually “metal vapor.” It’s:

- flux smoke
- irritating particulates
- poor indoor air

### 3.2 Cutting, sanding, and printing

Your lungs don’t care whether dust came from:

- sanding a 3D print
- cutting fiberglass board
- grinding a case

If it becomes airborne, it becomes respiratory exposure.

## 4. Ventilation: move the bad air away

**Definition:**

- **Ventilation** is the intentional introduction of outdoor air into a space to control indoor air quality by diluting and displacing pollutants.

Practical guidance (high-level):

- prefer local extraction (capture at the source) over “a fan somewhere in the room”
- don’t solder in a sealed room
- don’t aim a fan so it blows fumes into your face

If you can smell it, you are inhaling it.

---

## 5. Respirators and masks (use correctly)

**Definition:**

- A **respirator** is a mask designed to protect the wearer from inhaling hazardous atmospheres (vapors, gases, particulate matter), by filtering air or supplying clean air.

Key idea:

- different hazards require different filtration strategies

Practical rules:

- use the right protection for the hazard (dust vs fumes)
- fit matters; gaps defeat the purpose
- don’t reuse disposable protection beyond its intended life

If you don’t know what you’re exposed to, reduce exposure at the source and upgrade ventilation.

## 6. Cleanliness is safety

A lot of exposure happens after “the fun part.”

- sweeping dust makes it airborne again
- compressed air launches debris

Prefer:

- wet wipe / HEPA vacuum approaches (where appropriate)
- bag and label scrap materials

Keep food and drink away from:

- solder
- flux
- sanding dust

## 7. Copy‑paste safety checklist

```text
Eye safety:
- safety glasses within reach (Y/N)
- face shield/goggles for grinding/cutting (Y/N)

Respiratory:
- ventilation plan active (Y/N)
- fume extraction at soldering station (Y/N)
- dust generation tasks have containment/cleanup plan (Y/N)

Workspace:
- clear bench; no trip hazards
- flammables away from hot tools
- first-aid basics available

Habits:
- wash hands after soldering/cutting
- no food/drink on the bench
- stop when tired (mistakes spike)
```

---

## Practical takeaway

If you do nothing else:

- wear eye protection when things can fly
- ventilate when things can smoke
- treat dust like a contaminant, not an aesthetic problem

A deck that looks cool is optional.

Having two functioning eyes and lungs is not.
