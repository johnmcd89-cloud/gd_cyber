# 5.3 — Flux / Solvent Safety

Flux and solvents are the quiet hazards of electronics work.

They’re easy to treat as “just smells.”

They are not.

This chapter is a practical safety baseline for common bench chemicals used in cyberdeck building:

- fluxes (rosin/no-clean/water-soluble)
- isopropyl alcohol (IPA)
- acetone
- contact cleaners / aerosol solvents

It is not medical advice.

When in doubt, follow the product’s **Safety Data Sheet (SDS)** and local regulations.

## 1. SDS-first: know what you’re handling

**Definition:**

- A **Safety Data Sheet (SDS)** (formerly MSDS) is a document listing hazards, safe use instructions, and spill-handling procedures for substances and products.

Bench rule:

- If you can’t find the SDS, don’t treat the chemical as “safe.”

At minimum, read:

- hazards
- ventilation requirements
- flammability
- first aid
- disposal guidance

---

## 2. Common hazards (high level)

### 2.1 Irritation and sensitization

Flux fumes and solvent vapors can irritate eyes, skin, and lungs.

Even “mild” exposure becomes a problem when it is:

- frequent
- in a closed room
- combined with other exposures

### 2.2 Flammability

Many solvents are flammable.

Treat your bench like a small lab:

- keep solvents away from hot tools
- don’t spray aerosols near heat sources
- cap containers immediately

### 2.3 VOC exposure

**Definition:**

- **Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)** are organic compounds with high vapor pressure at room temperature; some VOCs are dangerous to human health or the environment.

Many bench solvents are VOCs.

The mitigation is mostly:

- ventilation
- reducing quantity exposed to air

## 3. Solvents you’ll see often

### 3.1 Isopropyl alcohol (IPA)

IPA is widely used for cleaning flux residues.

Practical hazards:

- dries skin (increasing irritation)
- vapor exposure in poorly ventilated spaces
- flammability

Practical handling:

- use small quantities in a dispenser bottle
- close the lid between uses
- ventilate

### 3.2 Acetone

Acetone is a stronger solvent used for some plastics/resins/adhesives.

It can also attack materials you care about.

Practical handling:

- assume it can damage plastics and finishes
- use minimal amounts
- keep away from ignition sources

### 3.3 Aerosol cleaners

Contact cleaners and “electronics sprays” can:

- deliver solvent quickly
- also deliver it into your lungs quickly

Practical handling:

- treat aerosols as a special hazard class
- spray only with strong ventilation
- avoid spraying toward your face (obvious, but people do it)

---

## 4. Ventilation: the real control

If you can smell flux or solvent strongly, your exposure is non-trivial.

Practical baseline:

- ventilate the workspace
- prefer local extraction (capture at source) for soldering/flux fumes
- don’t “fan the fumes around”; move them away and out

---

## 5. Storage and labeling

Most bench chemical accidents are:

- wrong bottle
- unlabeled bottle
- “mystery solvent”

Rules:

- label secondary containers (even if it’s just tape + marker)
- keep caps on
- store flammables appropriately
- don’t store solvents in drink bottles (ever)

---

## 6. Spill and cleanup mindset

An SDS will tell you specifics.

General principles:

- ventilate
- contain and absorb
- avoid spreading the chemical
- dispose of contaminated wipes appropriately

Never mix unknown chemicals.

---

## 7. Copy‑paste checklist

```text
Flux/solvent safety checklist:

Knowledge:
- SDS available for each chemical (Y/N)
- secondary containers labeled (Y/N)

Ventilation:
- ventilation active during soldering/cleaning (Y/N)
- local capture used for flux fumes (Y/N)

Fire safety:
- solvents away from hot tools (Y/N)
- aerosols not used near heat/sparks (Y/N)

Exposure:
- gloves available for extended solvent handling (Y/N)
- eye protection used when spraying/scrubbing (Y/N)

Storage/disposal:
- caps closed immediately (Y/N)
- contaminated wipes disposed responsibly (Y/N)
- no drink bottles used for chemicals (Y/N)
```

---

## Practical takeaway

Flux and solvents are manageable hazards.

If you do nothing else:

- read the SDS
- ventilate aggressively
- label everything
- treat flammability as real
