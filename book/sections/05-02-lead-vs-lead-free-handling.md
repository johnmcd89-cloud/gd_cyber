# 5.2 — Lead vs Lead‑Free Handling

Many cyberdeck builders end up with multiple solders, fluxes, and “bench chemistry.”

Some of it contains lead.

Some of it doesn’t.

This chapter is not a chemistry lecture.

It’s a practical handling policy you can adopt so you don’t accidentally turn your workbench into a contamination source.

It is not medical advice.

## 1. Why lead matters

Lead is a toxic metal.

**Definition (medical context):**

- **Lead poisoning** is metal poisoning caused by exposure to lead via contaminated air, water, dust, food, or consumer products.

For deck building, the day-to-day risk usually looks like:

- residue on hands
- dust and debris on the bench
- contamination moving from “work” areas into “food” areas

So the fix is mostly:

- hygiene
- segregation
- cleaning

## 2. Lead-free doesn’t mean “risk-free”

Lead-free solder exists for good reasons (including regulations).

**Context:**

- The EU **Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS)** restricts certain hazardous materials in electrical and electronic equipment.

But lead-free solders and fluxes can still produce:

- fumes/irritants (flux)
- particulates (cutting/sanding/cleanup)
- burns (hot tools)

So the safety baseline remains:

- ventilation
- eye protection
- no food/drink at the bench

## 3. A simple handling policy (bench rules)

### 3.1 Segregate

- label spools clearly: **LEAD** vs **LEAD‑FREE**
- keep separate soldering tips if you want strict separation
- keep leaded waste in a dedicated container

### 3.2 Assume hands are contaminated

- wash hands after soldering
- keep wipes nearby
- don’t touch your face while working

### 3.3 Keep food and drink out of the work zone

This is the single highest ROI rule.

If you eat on the bench, you’re doing exposure engineering.

### 3.4 Clean like you mean it

Avoid making dust airborne.

Prefer:

- wet wipes / damp paper towels (appropriate to the surface)
- HEPA vacuum where available

Avoid:

- dry sweeping
- blasting with compressed air

---

## 4. Disposal (high-level)

Local laws vary.

The practical guidance:

- don’t throw lead-containing waste into a kitchen trash can
- bag and label bench waste
- use local hazardous waste disposal options when appropriate

If you’re building at any scale, treat disposal as part of the project plan.

## 5. Copy‑paste checklist

```text
Lead vs lead-free handling checklist:

- spools labeled clearly (LEAD / LEAD-FREE)
- dedicated waste container for solder debris
- no food/drink at bench
- handwashing after soldering
- bench wiped down after sessions
- ventilation used during soldering
- eye protection used during clipping/cutting
- disposal plan for contaminated debris
```

---

## Practical takeaway

Lead vs lead-free is not a moral identity.

It’s a handling policy.

- label
- segregate
- clean
- wash hands

If you do those five things, your risk drops sharply.
