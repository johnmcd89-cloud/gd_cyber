# 75.1 Multi-radio integrated deck

A multi-radio integrated deck is a cyberdeck that contains more than one radio system.

A “radio system” is hardware that transmits or receives information using electromagnetic waves.

In practical cyberdecks, this often means a mixture of local networking radios (for example Wi‑Fi, a family of short-range wireless networking standards, and Bluetooth, a short-range personal-area networking radio), positioning receivers (for example Global Navigation Satellite System receivers), cellular radios, and long-range or specialist radios.

A common long-range example is a LoRa (long-range, low-power) radio module.

Another common specialist example is a software-defined radio receiver, which is a receiver that exposes raw radio samples so that much of the signal processing can be performed in software.

The promise is flexibility.

The risk is that the radios interfere with each other.

This section explains why multi-radio integration is difficult and how to design for isolation, electromagnetic interference management, antenna strategy, and power segmentation.

Everything here assumes legal and authorized use of radio equipment.

Radio regulations vary by country.

In the United States, many unlicensed “radio frequency devices” operate under Federal Communications Commission rules in Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 15.

Those rules include conditions such as not causing harmful interference and accepting interference that may cause undesired operation, as reflected in the required Part 15 compliance statements. [S26]

It is a design guide.

It is not an evasion guide.

## 75.1.1 The core problem: radios are both sensitive and loud

A radio receiver is designed to detect extremely small signals.

A radio transmitter is designed to generate relatively large signals.

If both are placed in the same small enclosure, energy can leak from the “loud” parts into the “sensitive” parts.

This can happen through the air.

It can also happen through shared conductors.

### Key definitions

Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is a disturbance generated by an external source that affects an electrical circuit by mechanisms such as electromagnetic induction, electrostatic coupling, or conduction.

Wikipedia describes EMI in these terms and notes that it can degrade performance or stop a circuit from functioning. [S1]

Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is the ability of equipment and systems to function acceptably in their electromagnetic environment by limiting the unintentional generation, propagation, and reception of electromagnetic energy that would cause unwanted effects.

Wikipedia describes EMC in these terms and organizes it around emissions, susceptibility, and immunity. [S2]

A multi-radio integrated deck is an EMC problem inside a single device.

A printed circuit board (PCB) is a laminated structure of conductive and insulating layers used to connect components into an electronic circuit.

Wikipedia describes printed circuit boards in these terms. [S3]

The phrase “radio frequency” refers to the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum commonly used for radio communication.

When EMI occurs in this frequency range, it is often called radio-frequency interference.

Wikipedia notes this terminology in its EMI article. [S1]

### Why “different bands” is not enough

It is tempting to assume that radios will not interfere if they use different frequency bands.

In practice, there are several failure modes.

One is that a strong nearby transmitter can overload a receiver’s input stage.

The receiver is not “hearing noise.”

It is being forced to operate outside its linear range.

Another is intermodulation distortion.

Intermodulation distortion is the creation of unwanted signals when multiple signals mix in a nonlinear device.

Wikipedia describes intermodulation and illustrates intermodulation products as spurious tones in a spectrum plot. [S4]

A third is coupling.

Coupling is simply energy finding a path from one subsystem to another.

Coupling can be radiated.

Coupling can also be conducted through shared power and ground paths.

A fourth is mechanical.

In a portable deck, connectors loosen.

Cables move.

Antennas detune when a hand grips the enclosure.

All of these cause “interference problems” that are not solved by frequency planning alone.

---

## 75.1.2 Isolation: making coupling paths weak

Isolation is the practice of reducing unintended coupling between subsystems.

For multi-radio decks, isolation is not one technique.

It is a layered strategy.

You reduce coupling by distance.

You reduce coupling by shielding.

You reduce coupling by filtering.

You reduce coupling by power and ground architecture.

### Near field versus far field

Close to an antenna, the near field dominates.

The near field and far field are regions of the electromagnetic field around an object such as a transmitting antenna.

Wikipedia describes near and far field behavior and notes that near-field strengths drop rapidly with distance. [S5]

This is a design opportunity.

Even small increases in physical separation can matter.

If you can move two antennas from 10 millimeters apart to 40 millimeters apart, you may get a meaningfully different result.

You should treat distance as an engineering resource.

### Shielding and compartments

Electromagnetic shielding is the practice of reducing electromagnetic fields in a space using barriers made of conductive or magnetic materials.

Wikipedia describes electromagnetic shielding in these terms and connects it to reducing EMI, including shielding for enclosures and cables. [S6]

In compact decks, shielding is often implemented as:

internal shielding cans over particularly sensitive radio front ends,

enclosure partitions that separate a noisy subsystem from a sensitive subsystem,

and careful control of openings where cables enter and exit.

A key rule is that shielding must be continuous.

Gaps and seams can behave like slot antennas.

In other words, a nearly closed shield can still radiate strongly.

### Shielding is also a cable problem

Many portable decks use external antennas.

This means radio-frequency signals are routed through cables.

A shielded cable is an electrical cable with a conductive layer around its conductors for electromagnetic shielding.

Wikipedia describes shielded cables in these terms and explains that the shield can act as a Faraday cage when properly grounded. [S7]

A Faraday cage is an enclosure used to block some electromagnetic fields.

Wikipedia describes Faraday cages in these terms. [S8]

In practical cyberdecks, a cable shield and an enclosure can function as small Faraday shields.

They only work if you provide a low-impedance connection to the reference ground.

If the shield is “floating,” it may provide little benefit and can sometimes make coupling worse.

---

## 75.1.3 Electromagnetic interference management: layout zones, return paths, and coexistence

Most multi-radio failures are not “mysterious radio problems.”

They are layout problems.

They are grounding problems.

They are cable problems.

If you control those, you usually gain more than you will from software tweaks.

### Ground return paths and ground planes

On a printed circuit board, a ground plane is a large conductive area connected to ground that serves as a return path for current.

Wikipedia describes ground planes in these terms. [S9]

The important practical point is that current does not only flow “out.”

It flows out and returns.

If you do not provide a controlled return path, the return current will take whatever path it can.

That path can run under sensitive radio circuitry.

That is how you create coupling.

### PCB zoning

A multi-radio board should be divided into functional zones.

Sensitive radio-frequency circuitry should have a quiet neighborhood.

High-speed digital areas should be kept away from those zones.

Noisy power conversion should be physically separated and filtered.

You can think of the board as a map.

Some regions are “allowed to be noisy.”

Some regions are “not allowed to be noisy.”

The boundaries matter.

### Coexistence inside a shared 2.4 gigahertz radio

Many cyberdeck designs combine multiple protocols in the same 2.4 gigahertz (GHz) Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band.

In some devices, Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth are not merely “near each other.”

They are implemented inside one chip that contains a single shared radio-frequency (RF) subsystem.

One common example is the ESP32, a family of low-cost microcontroller system-on-chip devices made by Espressif.

Espressif’s documentation for ESP32 describes radio coexistence as a time-division multiplexing method.

Time-division multiplexing is the practice of sharing a single resource by allocating it in time slices to different users.

It explains that when multiple modules share one 2.4 GHz radio, one protocol cannot transmit or receive while another is actively using the radio, so the system allocates time slices according to a coexistence policy. [S10]

This is a useful general principle even when you are not using an ESP32.

You must decide whether the design will physically separate radios, or intentionally share RF resources through scheduling and arbitration.

If you do neither, the system will “fight itself,” and the resulting failures will look like randomness.

### Practical printed circuit board layout guidance from vendor references

Vendor hardware design guidelines are valuable because they encode repeated practical lessons.

For example, Espressif’s hardware design guidelines recommend board layer stacks that preserve continuous ground reference planes, and they provide specific guidance on routing and ground usage for radio designs. [S11]

Their layout chapter recommends a four-layer board where one inner layer is reserved as a complete ground plane, and it describes how inner power routing can be done while preserving uninterrupted ground under radio-frequency and timing-critical circuitry. [S11]

Texas Instruments publishes application notes on reducing EMI through layout, such as application note SNVA489. [S12]

The specific device discussed in any one note is less important than the repeated theme: EMI reduction is often primarily a geometry problem.

Small, tight current loops radiate less.

Large, fast-switching loops radiate more.

You do not need to copy a reference design exactly.

You do need to adopt the principle that “layout is a circuit.”

---

## 75.1.4 Antenna strategy: placement, coupling, and band planning

An antenna is the interface between electric currents in conductors and radio waves propagating through space.

Wikipedia describes antennas in these terms. [S13]

Multi-radio decks often fail because antenna strategy is treated as an afterthought.

Antenna strategy should be designed from the beginning.

It includes antenna placement and orientation.

It includes expected hand and body effects.

And it includes how multiple antennas interact.

### Mutual detuning and near-field coupling

Antennas do not only “transmit and receive.”

They are also pieces of resonant metal.

When antennas are too close, they can detune each other.

They can also couple energy directly through near-field interactions.

The result can be reduced range, reduced receive sensitivity, and unpredictable performance.

If you have room, separate antennas.

If you do not have room, consider:

choosing antennas that are less sensitive to nearby structures,

adding shielding or absorbing materials in carefully tested ways,

and accepting that you may need to reduce transmit power or duty cycle to preserve reception.

### Filtering and shared antenna paths

A diplexer is a passive device that multiplexes two ports onto one port by separating signals into disjoint frequency bands.

Wikipedia describes a diplexer in these terms and notes that real devices have loss and leakage. [S14]

A duplexer is a device that isolates a receiver from a transmitter while permitting them to share a common antenna.

Wikipedia describes duplexers in these terms and notes that they may use frequency, polarization, or timing. [S15]

A band-pass filter is a device that passes frequencies in a range and attenuates frequencies outside that range.

Wikipedia describes band-pass filters in these terms. [S16]

These are not “magic parts.”

They are ways to control which energy reaches which receiver.

They become important when a transmitter in one subsystem would otherwise overload the receiver in another subsystem.

### Metal, ground planes, and enclosure effects

Antennas interact with nearby conductive surfaces.

A ground plane can be an intentional part of the antenna system.

Wikipedia describes a ground plane both as a radio concept and a printed circuit board concept. [S9]

In a cyberdeck, the enclosure may be metal.

Even if the enclosure is plastic, the internal wiring and ground planes are conductive structures.

These structures can change antenna impedance and radiation pattern.

Therefore, a multi-radio deck should be designed with a clear “antenna keep-out zone.”

A keep-out zone is a region where you intentionally avoid metal parts, cables, and high-current switching nodes.

---

## 75.1.5 Power segmentation: preventing conducted interference

Radios do not only interfere through the air.

They also interfere through the power system.

Power integrity is the discipline of ensuring that a power subsystem supports system performance without harmful noise and disturbances.

Wikipedia describes power integrity in these terms and connects it to power delivery network impedance design. [S17]

A multi-radio deck should segment power.

This means the power architecture is deliberately partitioned.

A simple, common approach is:

one main battery input stage,

separate regulators for noisy subsystems,

separate regulators for sensitive radio subsystems,

and filters between domains.

The goal is to prevent a transmitter’s current draw and switching noise from appearing as a voltage disturbance at another radio’s receiver front end.

### Decoupling and local energy storage

A decoupling capacitor is a capacitor used to prevent electrical energy from transferring from one part of a circuit to another by shunting noise.

Wikipedia describes decoupling capacitors in these terms. [S18]

Decoupling has two roles.

It provides a local source of current for fast load steps.

It also provides a low-impedance path for high-frequency noise.

Analog Devices’ tutorial MT-101 is a widely cited introduction to decoupling techniques.

It emphasizes that decoupling is frequency-dependent and placement-dependent.

A capacitor that is “electrically far away” may not help at all, even if it is “near” in a layout file. [S19]

### Grounding and mixed-signal partitioning

Multi-radio designs are often mixed-signal systems.

They combine radio-frequency analog circuitry with high-speed digital processing.

Analog Devices’ tutorial MT-031 discusses grounding and the practical issues of separating and connecting analog and digital grounds in real systems. [S20]

The key idea is not to create a “perfect separation.”

The key idea is to control return currents.

A badly connected split can create more problems than a solid plane.

Power segmentation is therefore not only about voltage regulators.

It is also about return path engineering.

---

## 75.1.6 Validation: design for measurement, not hope

Multi-radio integration should be validated systematically.

A useful mental model is to ensure each radio works well alone, then integrate one additional radio at a time, and measure what changes.

When performance changes, do not assume the radio is “bad.”

Assume that a coupling path exists.

Your task is to find and weaken it.

### Practical tests that fit a hobby lab

You can make progress without a professional compliance lab.

For example, you can observe receiver sensitivity while you transmit on another radio, measure supply rail noise during transmit bursts, and use a spectrum analyzer or software-defined radio receiver to look for spurious signals.

A compact validation checklist is:

- Each radio meets its baseline performance when operated alone.
- When radios operate together, you can identify which pairings cause problems (for example “radio A transmit breaks radio B receive”).
- Supply rails remain within tolerance during worst-case transmit bursts.
- Antennas remain properly connected and stable under handling, flex, and enclosure assembly.
- Cables and shields are bonded consistently, and the device does not become “more noisy” when moved or touched.
- The system has an operational mode for “quiet receive” (for example disabling known noisy transmitters while receiving weak signals).

A Faraday cage or shielded box is sometimes used during debugging to reduce external signals.

Wikipedia describes Faraday cages as enclosures used to block some electromagnetic fields. [S8]

The goal is not secrecy.

The goal is a controlled environment.

### Standards context

Many product-level EMC requirements are expressed through standards.

The International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR) is a body founded to set standards for controlling electromagnetic interference in electrical and electronic devices, and it operates as part of the International Electrotechnical Commission.

Wikipedia describes CISPR in these terms. [S21]

A cyberdeck may never be a regulated commercial product.

Even so, standards vocabulary is useful because it gives you a measurement framework.

It encourages you to distinguish between radiated emissions and conducted emissions.

It also encourages you to separate emissions from immunity.

## 75.1.7 Use cases and community practice

Multi-radio decks are popular because they support field work.

A single device can combine network access, mapping, logging, and direct visibility into the local radio environment.

Community builds frequently integrate Wi‑Fi with a software-defined radio (SDR).

A software-defined radio is a radio system in which significant parts of modulation, demodulation, filtering, or tuning are implemented in software rather than fixed analog circuitry.

In hobby cyberdecks, this often means a general-purpose computer paired with a small receiver that can sample a wide range of frequencies.

For example, Hackaday has covered cyberdeck handheld builds that integrate an RTL-SDR receiver inside an otherwise general-purpose portable device. [S22]

RTL-SDR is a popular family of low-cost Universal Serial Bus (USB) software-defined radio receivers originally derived from mass-market television tuner hardware.

r/cyberDeck posts also frequently describe portable builds that include an SDR receiver alongside computing hardware and other peripherals. [S23]

Long-range mesh radios are another common addition.

For example, some builders integrate LoRa-based mesh tools such as Meshtastic.

LoRa is a long-range, low-power radio modulation scheme often used in unlicensed bands for low-data-rate communication.

Meshtastic is an open-source project that uses LoRa radios to build low-bandwidth mesh networks.

Builders sometimes treat these radios as swappable add-on modules rather than permanent integration.

r/cyberDeck discussions illustrate this “add radios as modules” mindset. [S24]

Hackaday also provides secondary-source coverage of cyberdeck culture that emphasizes functional devices rather than purely aesthetic props. [S25]

The practical takeaway is that culture and engineering align here.

People want devices that can evolve.

A multi-radio deck that is easy to service and upgrade is more valuable than a fragile integrated sculpture.
