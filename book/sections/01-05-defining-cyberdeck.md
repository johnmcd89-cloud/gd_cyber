# 1.5 — Defining “Cyberdeck”

Most words have borders.

“Cyberdeck” mostly doesn’t.

It started as a fictional object: a personal computer used to interface with cyberspace. Then maker culture adopted the word as a banner for a particular kind of portable, custom computer — part workstation, part art object.

So when someone asks *“what counts as a cyberdeck?”* there are two honest answers:

1. **In fiction:** a cyberdeck is a tool for *jacking in*.
2. **In maker culture:** a cyberdeck is a computer that looks and feels like it belongs to that fiction.

This chapter gives you a working definition that’s useful for building (and for not arguing on the internet).

## 1. The term’s two homes: fiction and workshops

In cyberpunk fiction (notably William Gibson’s work), concepts like **cyberspace** and “jacking in” helped shape what people imagined computers *could* be.

In maker culture, a “cyberdeck” is often described as an artisan-crafted portable computer, frequently powered by a single-board computer, with a display and keyboard, built in a cyberpunk aesthetic.

The same word describes:

- a narrative device (fiction)
- a hardware class (maker practice)

Any definition that ignores one of these homes will feel wrong to someone.

## 2. A practical definition (for this book)

**Working definition:**

A **cyberdeck** is a **portable computer** built as a **custom object**, where **form factor and interface** are intentionally designed (not incidental), and where the build expresses a **cyberpunk-inspired aesthetic** *and/or* a **field-workstation intent**.

That definition has four moving parts:

1. **portable** (it is meant to travel)
2. **computer** (it runs compute workloads, not just a single appliance function)
3. **custom object** (enclosure + integration are part of the project)
4. **intentional interface** (display/input/I/O are considered, not accidental)

The aesthetic is common, but the intent is what prevents the word from collapsing into “any laptop stickered black.”

## 3. The three-axis model: why debates happen

People argue about cyberdecks because they optimize different axes.

### Axis A — Aesthetic fidelity

- Does it look like it belongs in a cyberpunk world?
- Does it communicate “deck” at a glance?

### Axis B — Portability and integration

- Can you carry it without babying it?
- Is it a coherent object, not loose parts?

### Axis C — Workstation intent

- Does it reduce friction in a real workflow?
- Can it be used for hours, repaired, and trusted?

A build that is high on A but low on C can still be a cyberdeck.

A build that is high on C but low on A might be a “portable workstation” but not feel like a cyberdeck to the culture.

This is why the word is elastic.

## 4. Taxonomy: prop, tool, instrument

In Chapter 1.2 we described an evolution ladder:

```text
Toy/Prop:   it boots, it looks cool
Tool:       it performs a workflow reliably
Instrument: it produces trustworthy results and logs how it did so
```

Here’s the cyberdeck framing:

- **Prop deck:** optimized for story and aesthetics; may be fragile
- **Tool deck:** optimized for repeatable use; still styled
- **Instrument deck:** optimized for trust and measurement; documentation-first

All three are legitimate *projects*. Only the latter two are usually good daily drivers.

## 5. Boundary cases (and how to classify them)

### 5.1 “A laptop in a Pelican case”

This can be a cyberdeck if:

- the enclosure and interface were intentionally designed
- the case is not just a storage box but a usable form factor

If it’s simply “a laptop stored in a case,” it is not.

### 5.2 “A tablet with a keyboard”

A tablet can be a cyberdeck if:

- it becomes a *custom integrated object* (mounts, power, I/O)
- it is built around a deliberate interface story

If it is just a retail tablet + retail keyboard, it is more “consumer portable computing” than cyberdeck.

### 5.3 “A radio rig with minimal compute”

If the device is primarily a single-purpose instrument (e.g., a radio appliance) it may be better described as:

- a field instrument
- a comms rig

But if it includes general compute (scripts, logging, UI, data hygiene) and is integrated as a portable workstation, it can be cyberdeck-adjacent or fully within the category.

The goal is usefulness, not purity.

## 6. Decision tree (fast classification)

### Figure 1 — “Is it a cyberdeck?”

```text
Is it intended to be portable?
  ├─ no → not a cyberdeck (probably a desktop rig)
  └─ yes
       ↓
Is there general-purpose compute?
  ├─ no → probably an instrument/appliance
  └─ yes
       ↓
Is it a custom integrated object (not just off-the-shelf parts)?
  ├─ no → portable computer, not necessarily a cyberdeck
  └─ yes
       ↓
Does it intentionally express a cyberdeck interface/aesthetic?
  ├─ no → portable workstation (cyberdeck-adjacent)
  └─ yes → cyberdeck
```

---

## Practical takeaway

Use “cyberdeck” as a **direction**, not a courtroom category.

If you’re building:

- decide your axis priorities (aesthetic vs workstation)
- document what you chose and why
- don’t apologize for being a beginner

The best cyberdecks aren’t the ones that win definitions.

They’re the ones that get used.
