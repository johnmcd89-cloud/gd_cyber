# 6.5 — Storage and Travel

Lithium batteries are safe enough to carry every day.

They are not safe enough to treat casually.

Storage and travel failures are usually boring:

- terminals short against keys/coins
- packs get crushed
- batteries bake in a hot car

This section is about reducing the odds of those failures.

It is not legal advice.

For flying and shipping rules, check official guidance for your jurisdiction and carrier.

## 1. Storage risks

### 1.1 Short circuits in bags and drawers

Most travel incidents start with a short.

Controls:

- cover exposed terminals (tape/caps)
- keep spares in retail packaging or an organizer
- never store loose cells with metal objects

### 1.2 Mechanical damage

Travel means crush and puncture risk.

Controls:

- rigid cases for spares
- don’t pack cells where they can be bent
- inspect packs after rough travel

### 1.3 Temperature extremes

Avoid:

- leaving packs in hot cars
- storing near heaters
- freezing conditions without thinking through condensation and performance

Heat increases risk.

### 1.4 Water exposure

Water + lithium packs + dirt + connectors is a bad combo.

Controls:

- keep spares dry
- bag packs when traveling
- don’t charge wet devices

## 2. Storage practices (practical baseline)

- store batteries in a dry, cool place
- keep spares physically separated and protected from short circuits
- label unknown packs; don’t keep “mystery” batteries long-term
- if a cell is swollen, leaking, punctured, or smells odd: isolate it

For long-term storage state-of-charge:

- follow cell/pack manufacturer guidance (many recommend storing partially charged)

## 3. Air travel: high-level guidance

Lithium batteries are treated as regulated items in transport.

**Definition:**

- **Dangerous goods** are substances that pose risk to health, safety, property, or the environment during transport.

### 3.1 Spare batteries

FAA guidance (PackSafe) notes that:

- spare (uninstalled) lithium batteries (including power banks) must be carried in **carry-on** baggage
- terminals must be protected from short circuit

Rules vary by airline and battery size.

If you travel with large packs, check official rules before you show up at the airport.

### 3.2 Installed batteries (devices)

Installed packs (laptop, phone, deck) are typically handled differently than loose spares.

If you can remove a pack safely, you may prefer traveling with it installed to reduce exposed terminals.

## 4. Copy‑paste checklist

```text
Storage & travel checklist:

Short prevention:
- terminals covered / packaged (Y/N)
- spares not loose with metal objects (Y/N)

Mechanical:
- spares in rigid case / protected pocket (Y/N)
- no bending/crushing loads on pouches (Y/N)

Environment:
- not left in hot car / direct sun (Y/N)
- kept dry; no charging when wet (Y/N)

Air travel:
- spares carried in carry-on (per official guidance) (Y/N)
- airline rules checked for size/quantity limits (Y/N)
```

## Practical takeaway

Treat battery transport like transporting matches:

- prevent accidental contact
- keep them protected
- keep them out of heat

The pack you can’t short is the pack that won’t surprise you.
