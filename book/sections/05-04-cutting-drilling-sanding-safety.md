# 5.4 — Cutting / Drilling / Sanding Safety

Cyberdeck building is not only electronics.

It is also mechanical work:

- cutting enclosures
- drilling port holes
- sanding prints
- grinding brackets

Most makers get injured doing the “simple” steps.

This chapter is a practical safety baseline.

It is not training and not medical advice.

If you use power tools, read manufacturer manuals and follow local shop rules.

## 1. The hazard model: energy + sharp + airborne

Cutting and sanding hazards come in three families:

1) **projectiles**

- chips
- broken discs
- snapped drill bits

2) **entanglement and kickback**

- spinning tools grabbing material
- loose clothing/hair caught in tools

3) **airborne exposure**

- dust
- microplastics
- fiberglass particles

Add a fourth that people ignore:

4) **noise**

Hearing damage is permanent and quiet.

## 2. PPE: reduce exposure when other controls aren’t enough

**Definition:**

- **Personal protective equipment (PPE)** is protective clothing/equipment designed to protect the wearer from injury or infection.

PPE is not a substitute for safe setup.

But it is the last line of defense.

### 2.1 Eye protection (non-negotiable)

**Definition:**

- **Safety glasses** are eye protection worn to shield the eyes from debris and injury.

Practical rule:

- if anything can fly, you wear eye protection

Grinding/cutting often benefits from:

- safety glasses + face shield

### 2.2 Hearing protection (often ignored)

**Definition:**

- A **hearing protection device** is ear protection worn when exposed to hazardous noise to help prevent noise-induced hearing loss.

If you’re grinding or using loud tools, assume you need it.

### 2.3 Respiratory protection (for dust)

Sanding and cutting can generate particulate matter.

If you can see dust in the air, you’re inhaling it.

Prefer:

- dust extraction at the source
- masks/respirators appropriate to the task

---

## 3. Engineering controls: the controls that actually work

### 3.1 Clamp the work

**Definition:**

- A **clamp** is a fastening device used to hold objects tightly together to prevent movement.

Practical rule:

- don’t hold work with your hand if a clamp can hold it

If the tool grabs, it should grab the clamp setup—not your fingers.

### 3.2 Guarding and tool selection

High-speed rotary tools (Dremel-style) and angle grinders are common in cyberdeck builds.

- they remove material fast
- they also remove mistakes fast

Keep guards installed.

Use the least aggressive tool that can do the job.

### 3.3 Dust capture and cleanup

- vacuum extraction during sanding
- wipe surfaces after sanding
- avoid blasting debris with compressed air

---

## 4. Task-specific notes

### 4.1 Drilling

A drill makes holes or drives fasteners.

Drilling hazards:

- bit grabs and spins the work
- chips in the eye

Mitigations:

- clamp the work
- start with a pilot hole
- don’t force the bit

### 4.2 Sanding

Sandpaper removes material from surfaces.

Sanding hazards:

- dust exposure
- repetitive strain

Mitigations:

- sand wet where appropriate
- capture dust
- take breaks

### 4.3 Grinding / cutting

Angle grinders and rotary tools are powerful.

Grinding/cutting hazards:

- disc shatter
- sparks and heat
- kickback

Mitigations:

- face protection
- keep flammables away
- don’t side-load a cutting disc

---

## 5. “Do not do this” list

- do not freehand grind small parts near your fingers
- do not remove tool guards to “see better”
- do not use cracked discs or damaged bits
- do not sand/cut unknown materials without dust control
- do not work tired when using high-energy tools

---

## 6. Copy‑paste checklist

```text
Cut/drill/sand safety checklist:

Setup:
- work clamped (Y/N)
- cutting path clear of hands (Y/N)
- flammables cleared away (Y/N)

PPE:
- eye protection on (Y/N)
- hearing protection available (Y/N)
- dust control (vacuum/mask) in use (Y/N)

Tooling:
- guards installed (Y/N)
- disc/bit inspected (Y/N)

Cleanup:
- dust collected (not blown) (Y/N)
- bench wiped down (Y/N)
```

---

## Practical takeaway

If you want one rule:

- **clamp the work and protect your eyes**

The second rule:

- treat dust like a hazard

The third rule:

- stop when you’re tired

A deck build is not worth an injury.
